# Indexing the blockchain contents
    
## The graph
1. Instead of reading the event from moralis as in [this](https://github.com/sadityakumar9211/nextjs-nft-marketplace-moralis) project
2. We will index them with The Graph and we're gonna read from the graph protocol

> This makes this NFT marketplace completely end-to-end decentralized.


## What is The Graph?
- Decentralised Network for storing the events data


### Deployed to the following URIs:
- IPFS Hash: QmTahM2DWmLq67go9HqPXKSSUdgFTbvqUhErnVeC8r6o9s
