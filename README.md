Moralis: How do we tell it to listen to our events? 

1. Connect it to our blockchain (hardhat localhost blockchain)
2. Which contract, which events, and what to do when it hears those events. 



# The graph
1. Instead of reading the event from moralis 
2. We will index them with graph and we're gonna read from the graph


## What is The Graph?
- Decentralised Network for storing the events data
